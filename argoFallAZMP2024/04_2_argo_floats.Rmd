## Argo Floats {#argo-floats}

During the DY18402, DFO and NOC collaboratively deployed 2 Argo floats from the RRS _Discovery_ in support of the international [Argo program](https://argo.ucsd.edu/). Both floats were PROVOR biogeochemical (BGC) models, which record temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll fluorescence, and backscatter. The first float was deployed at station HL_07 after completion of the CTD and ring net operations. The second float, which was initially planned for deployment at station LL_09, was deployed further south in approximately 3960 m of water, at the location of a mooring deployment (M2300). The decision to deploy the float at this location instead of at AZMP station LL_09 was to take advantage of deeper water and good weather, which was forecasted to deteriorate later that day. 

```{r argo figure 1, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Argo float deployment locations"}
# knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures", "deployment_map.png"))
```

Both floats were deployed by hand by two crew using a slip rope that was tied off on the ship's infrastructure for leverage. One hour prior to deployment, the floats were pre-tested to confirm establishment of the float's GPS and iridium communications. The floats will remain active for approximately 5 years, collecting vertical profiles from the surface to 2000 m every 10 days.

The first profile recorded by each float is shown in figure \@ref(fig:argo-figure-2). For salinity, oxygen, and chlorophyll, analogous water samples are shown as well. The floats perform thei first ascent 2 days following deployment, so it is important to keep in mind when comparing the ship and float data that they are separated temporally and potentially spatially depending on the drift of the float during that time. In the case of the float deployed at mooring station M2300, the nearest station in both time and space is Louisbourg 9 (LL_09), which is about 15 Nautical miles away from the mooring station. 

At both stations, float and bottle samples are grossly well aligned. Float oxygen data have been adjusted by a gain factor calculated by comparing the Argo surface data to the nearest available surface data in the World Ocean Atlas. For float 4902674 deployed at HL_07, float measurements are slightly higher than bottle samples at depth, but this may be resolved later as the gain factor may change as more profiles are collected, or by using in-air samples taken by float while at the surface, which are preferred over in-water samples for correction.

```{r argo-figure-2, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Initial profile for Argo floats 4902674 and 4902678 deployed at stations HL_07 and M2300 respectively. Solid coloured lines show float data, and square points show water sample data for salinity (autosal), oxygen (Winkler titrations), and chlorophyll (flourometry) from stations HL_07 and LL_09 respectively. Insets on the chlorophyll plots (d, i) show the surface layer."}

```

Chlorophyll measurements are very well aligned at HL_07, showing good agreement in magnitude and location of the deep chlorophyll maximum in the mixed layer. Comparison of float and chlorophyll measurements from LL_09 and the float deployed at M2300 are not as well aligned, but this could be a result of the spatial and temporal difference between the measurements.
