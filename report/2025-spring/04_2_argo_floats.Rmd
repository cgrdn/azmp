## Argo Floats {#argo-floats}

During the EN728, DFO deployed 2 Argo floats from the RV _Endeavor_ in support of the international [Argo program](https://argo.ucsd.edu/) [@wong2020]. Both floats were NKE ARVOR core float models, which record temperature, conductivity, and depth. The first float was deployed at station HL_07 after completion of the CTD and ring net operations. The second float was deployed at station LL_09, also following CTD and ring net operations. The location of each deployment can be seen in figure \@ref(fig:argo-figure-1).

```{r argo-figure-1, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Argo float deployment locations"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures", "deployment_map.png"))
```

Both floats were deployed by hand by two crew using a slip line from the aft starbourd deck while the ship was underway doing 1-2 kts. One hour prior to deployment, the floats were pre-tested to confirm establishment of the float's GPS and iridium communications. The floats will remain active for approximately 5 years, collecting vertical profiles from the surface to 2000 m every 10 days.

The first profile recorded by each float is shown in figure \@ref(fig:argo-figure-2). This profile taken on the ascent of the float occurs two days after the deployment. Salinity measurements made by the floats are well aligned with salinometer measurements taken from bottle samples. 

```{r argo-figure-2, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Initial temperature (a, c) and salinity (b, d) profiles for Argo floats 4902699 and 4902702 deployed at stations HL_07 and LL_09 respectively. Solid lines show the Argo profile and square markers on the salinity plots show the bottle samples (salinometer)."}
