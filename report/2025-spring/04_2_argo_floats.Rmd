## Argo Floats {#argo-floats}

During the EN728, DFO deployed 2 Argo floats from the RV _Endeavor_ in support of the international [Argo program](https://argo.ucsd.edu/) . Both floats were NKE ARVOR core float models, which record temperature, conductivity, and depth. The first float was deployed at station HL_07 after completion of the CTD and ring net operations. The second float was deployed at station LL_09, also following CTD and ring net operations. 

```{r argo figure 1, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Argo float deployment locations"}
# knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures", "deployment_map.png"))
```

Both floats were deployed by hand by two crew using a slip rope that was tied off on the ship's infrastructure for leverage. One hour prior to deployment, the floats were pre-tested to confirm establishment of the float's GPS and iridium communications. The floats will remain active for approximately 5 years, collecting vertical profiles from the surface to 2000 m every 10 days.
